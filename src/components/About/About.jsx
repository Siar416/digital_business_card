            Hello World! My name is Siar Wahidi and I'm an aspiring Web
            Developer who has recently graduated from BrainStations Full-Stack
            Web Development Bootcamp in April 2022. I have a passion for
            learning and I'm always looking to improve my skills. I've always
            had an interest in technology so making the career transition into
            Web Development came naturally.
