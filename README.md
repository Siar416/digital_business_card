## Digital Business Card

I built a simple digital business card application using React to solidify my understanding of key concepts such as component architecture and separation of concerns. The application was developed based on a design file created in Figma, ensuring visual fidelity throughout the development process.

## Docker

I utilized this simple application as an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with Docker and containerization. By Dockerizing my project, I deepened my understanding of containerization principles and enhanced my familiarity with Docker's workflow and features.
